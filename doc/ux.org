#+TITLE: Legalese User Experience

* Acquisition: Interested User Encounters Legalese

User might remember Legalese from seeing it at the bottom of some other legal agreement they signed in the last couple of years.

User has experienced a trigger event which gives rise to a pain point:

** hiring a new employee
*** now needs an employment agreement and a corresponding ESOP
doesn't know they might also need a dora

if the ESOP is being set up for the first time, might need an alteration to the articles
and all the consents that that implies.
** hiring a new cofounder
*** now needs a vesting agreement and to extend the shareholder agreement
