		  <p>These tutorials create working docsets for incorporation and seed/angel fundraising. Complex corporate workflows require multiple contracts which all agree with one another.
		  <h2 id="t1">Tutorial 1: the EULA<a href="images/Legalese EULA for mengwong@jfdi.asia.pdf"><img class="rhs" src="images/Legalese EULA for mengwong@jfdi.asia.png"></a></h2>
		  
		  <p>A <b>signatory</b> fills in a Google Form and get back an agreement to sign. They don't have to know Legalese even exists.</p>

		  <ol>
			<li> In this tutorial, you see how Legalese might appear to a third-party signatory.</li>
			<li> Legalese.io takes the role of a Company, providing you an End-User License Agreement.</li>
			<li> You take the role of an end-user signing the License Agreement.</li>
			<li> In future, you will take the role of the Company generating agreements for others.</li>
			<li> Legalese.io invites you to <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/jfdi.asia/forms/d/1RIB2E2-SfXBTLKVlwhRx08UnUeYoN5yjnaJrvqZavUE/viewform">fill in a simple form with your name and email address.</a></li>
			<li> A few minutes later, check your mail. You should see a PDF agreement there. <i>If you don't receive the EULA, that's because there is a bug in the software that does OAuth integration with EchoSign. Sorry, this is still alpha software. We're working on it.</i></li>
			<li> To complete the tutorial, sign the EULA.</li>
		  </ol>

		  <p><i>After running this tutorial, you will have:</i> seen what Legalese's Particulars form looks like to a third-party signatory, seen the output PDF, and signed it.</p>

		  <h2 id="t2">Tutorial 2: Hello, World!<a href="images/Hello World for mengwong+buyer@jfdi.asia.pdf"><img class="rhs whitebg" src="images/Hello World for mengwong+buyer@jfdi.asia.png"></a></h2>
		  
		  <p>You set up a Yellow Spreadsheet for the first time. You are now a <b>power user</b>!</p>
		  <ol>
			<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rBuKOWSqRE7QgKgF6uVWR9www4LoLho4UjOCHPQplhw/copy?id=1rBuKOWSqRE7QgKgF6uVWR9www4LoLho4UjOCHPQplhw&copyCollaborators=false&copyComments=false&title=My%20Legalese%20Tutorial%202&usp=sheets_web">Copy our template to your Google Drive account.</a></li>
			<li> (Say yes to "Make a copy?")</li>
			<li> You should be in the Hello World tab. Some of the cells are bright yellow. We chose the same shade of yellow that you've seen in Word docs where you're expected to fill in the blanks.</li>
			<li> Go ahead and fill in your particulars in the blank Row 14. If you leave it blank, we'll make something up for you. Change the email address for the <i>Acme Example</i> company to be one of your email addresses.</li>
			<li> What about the cells that aren't in yellow? You can look, but don't touch. Yet.</li>
			<li> Create an agreement! Click <i>Add-ons / Legalese / Generate PDFs</i>. Approve the authorization request.</li>
			<li> Cross your fingers. Because sometimes it doesn't work. Usually it's Google's fault. But sometimes it's our fault. We're in beta. :-/</li>
			<li> If it didn't work, try again. If it still doesn't work, get <a href="support.html">support</a>.</li>
			<li> Enough pessimism! Let's assume it worked. A link will appear in cell E6 of the spreadsheet. It leads to an output folder in Google Drive.</li>
			<li> In that folder, you should see an XML file. Yay! You are not expected to understand the XML. That's the job of the Legalese Robot.</li>
			<li> Wait three minutes for the Legalese Robot to turn the XML into a PDF.</li>
			<li> (While you wait, you might check out the README file.)</li>
			<li> If, after three minutes, a PDF doesn't appear, just reload the web page.</li>
		  </ol>

		  <p> <i>After running this tutorial, you will have:</i> gotten comfortable with Legalese's Yellow Spreadsheets, created a PDF of your own, read the README, and glanced at the XML source files.</p>

		  <p><b>I noticed the output folder was shared with robot@legalese.io. What if I have confidential information?</b> Very perceptive of you! The Legalese Robot operates without any human involvement, turning XML into PDF tirelessly, day and night. In the normal course of operation, no human views your agreements. If debugging or troubleshooting is needed, only with your permission will a human view your XML or PDF files. (Errors are logged to a separate file which help us debug without ever viewing your agreements.)</p>

		  <p><b>Are the yellow spreadsheets shared?</b> No, the yellow spreadsheets are not shared with the Legalese Robot. The robot only has access to your XML, which it needs to generate the PDFs.</p>

		  <h2 id="t3">Tutorial 3: Send for Signature
			<a href="images/Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 1.16.04 am.png"><img class="rhs whitebg" src="images/Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 1.16.04 am.png"></a>
		  </h2>

		  <p>You, a <b>power user</b>, inject the <i>Hello World</i> PDF into an e-signature service which emails it to you for signing.</p>

		  <ol>
			<li> Open the Google Drive folder that contains the <i>Hello World</i> PDF.</li>
			<ul>
			  <li> The folder is named <i>My Legalese Tutorial Hello World</i>.</li>
			  <li> (If you don't know how to find the folder, begin by going back to the yellow spreadsheet.)</li>
			  <li> (If you don't know how to find the yellow spreadsheet, search your Google Drive for <b>My Legalese Tutorial</b>.)</li>
			  <li> (If you don't want to search, start at <i>My Drive</i> and open <i>Legalese Root</i>. Everything that Legalese does is in there. We created this folder for you automatically.)</li>
			</ul>
			<li> Select the <i>Hello World</i> PDF.</li>
			<li> Right-click the PDF (or hit <b>a</b> if you're a keyboard geek).</li>
			<li> Open With: <i>E-Sign with EchoSign</i>.</li>
			<li> If you don't see the <i>EchoSign</i> option, click <i>Connect More Apps</i> to add it.
			<li> Enter the To: and CC: addresses based on what's shown in the README file. The order matters.</li>
			<li> If you're using EchoSign, you'll notice that the signature blocks are already in the right place.</li>
			<li> Go ahead and send for signature!</li>
		  </ol>

		  <p> <i>After running this tutorial, you will have:</i> set up an e-signature back-end and sent a PDF for signature.</p>
	  
		  <p><b>When the signature service asks me for the signers' email addresses, what should I say?</b> Open up the README file and enter the email addresses shown in the To: line.</p>

		  <p><b>What if I prefer DocuSign / HelloSign / some other e-signature backend?</b> That's fine; you can certainly do that. The advantage of EchoSign is that the PDFs contain embedded Signature Blocks which EchoSign knows how to read. If you use some other signature service, you will need to manually place the signature blocks.</p>

		  <h2 id="t4">Tutorial 4: A Real Nondisclosure Agreement
			<a href="images/Nondisclosure Agreement for mengwong+buyer@jfdi.asia.pdf"><img class="rhs whitebg" src="images/Nondisclosure Agreement for mengwong+buyer@jfdi.asia.png"></a>
		  </h2>
		  
		  <p>You, a <b>power user</b>, choose a real-world docset, and create a real-world agreement, taking advantage of the <i>INCLUDE</i> keyword to reuse the entities from a different tab.</p>

		  <ol>
			<li> Look at the row of tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.</li>
			<li> You will see tabs with names like <i>NDA</i>, <i>Entities</i>, <i>Incorporation</i>, <i>Class F</i>, and <i>Seed Round</i>.</li>
			<li> Let's start with a simple agreement: a nondisclosure.</li>
			<li> Go to the <b>NDA</b> tab.</li>
			<li> Note that one of the section headings is <i>INCLUDE Hello World</i>. That tells Legalese to load the <i>Entities</i> data from the <i>Hello World</i> tab.</li>
			<li> Generate PDFs and wait a couple minutes for the PDF to show up.</li>
			<li> This time, you should see that the PDF is now a nondisclosure agreement.</li>
			<li> There are two kinds of NDAs: unilateral and bilateral. Change cell B9 to suit, and generate again, if necessary.</li>
			<li> If you actually want to send a real NDA, update the Entities in Hello Word with real particulars, then repeat the steps from <a href="#t3">Tutorial 3</a>.
		  </ol>

		  <p> <i>After running this tutorial, you will have:</i> created a real NDA ready for execution.</p>

		  <p><b>What does the <i>Counterparty</i> line in the <i>ROLES</i> section mean?</b> The NDA template uses two parties: the Company, and the Counterparty. Cell B13 says <i>[Buyer]</i>, which means: every Buyer is a Counterparty, so Legalese defines Counterparties by substituting the Buyer from the <i>Hello World</i> tab.</p>

		  <hr />





		  <h2 id="t5">Tutorial 5: Introducing Docsets</h2>
		  <p>You, a <b>power user</b>, browse all the docsets that are available in Legalese. A docset generates one or more agreements. So far, all the docsets you've seen contain only one agreement.</p>

		  <ol>
			<li> Look at the row of tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.</li>
			<li> You will see tabs with names like <i>NDA</i>, <i>Entities</i>, <i>Incorporation</i>, <i>Class F</i>, and <i>Seed Round</i>.</li>
			<li> You can generate dummy agreements by going to each tab and clicking Generate PDFs. Each tab except <i>Entities</i>, that is.</li>
		  </ol>

		  <h3 id="t5_entities">Entities
			<a href="images/Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 1.30.10 am.png"><img class="rhs" src="images/Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 1.30.10 am.png"></a>
		  </h3>
		  <p>This tab is special. It contains the particulars of the parties to your agreements. It doesn't generate any agreements; other agreements refer to this.</p>
		  <p>Why? Because the names and addresses of your company, founders, employees, and investors are details used by multiple different agreements. The DRY principle says we should keep all that information in one place and not repeat it. So it lives in the <b>Entities</b> tab instead of repeating across multiple tabs.</p>

		  <h3 id="t5_incorporation" class="clear">Incorporation
		  	<a href="images/03 - Shareholders' Agreement.pdf"><img class="rhs whitebg" src="images/03 - Shareholders' Agreement.png"></a>
</h3>
		  <p>All the paperwork involved in an incorporation is available here:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Memorandum and Articles of Assocation</li>
			<li>Form 45 (if Singapore)</li>
			<li>JFDI Standard Shareholders Agreement</li>
			<li>JFDI Standard Volunteer Agreement</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>In the next tutorial, you produce all the paperwork needed for incorporation.</p>
		  
		  <hr class="clear" />
		  




		  <h2 id="t6">Tutorial 6: Incorporation
		  	<a href="images/01 - Memorandum and Articles of Association.pdf"><img class="rhs whitebg" src="images/01 - Memorandum and Articles of Association.png"></a>
</h2>
		  <p>You, a <b>power user</b>, configure the spreadsheets to create <i>multiple</i> agreements within a single document set.</p>

		  <ol>
			<li> Go to the <i>Incorporation</i> tab.</li>
			<li> Generate PDFs.</li>
			<li> In a few minutes you should see dummy documents for Frog Porridge Pte. Ltd., a company with three froggy founders and one wormy intern.</li>
			<li> Look under the <i>Configuration</i> section. You'll see a line that says <i>Templates:</i>, followed by four templates named <i>jfdi_memorandum</i>, <i>form45</i>, <i>jfdi_shareholders_agreement</i>, and <i>jfdi_volunteer_agreement</i>. When you click <i>Generate PDFs</i>, those templates get filled.</li>
			<li> If you happen to actually be generating a Singapore company, put real particulars into the <i>Entities</i> tab.</li>
			<li> You'll also need to put real particulars into the <i>Roles</i> section. You might need to have a heart-to-heart with your co-founders before you fill in <i>num_shares</i>.</li>
		  </ol>

		  <p>: You, a <b>content developer</b>, learn how to fix bugs, develop tests, and submit patches for Legalese's XML template trove. How does Test-Driven Development work for contracts and legal documents?</p>

		  <p>Every advanced content developer moves in the direction of becoming a software developer; this is inevitable, and quite aligned with our premise -- <em>software is eating law</em>. Here are some introductions to the art and craft of computer programming.</p>
		  
		  <ol>
			<li> <a href="http://www.grok2.com/progfun.html">The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.</a>
			<li> <i><a href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/482/482readings/phaedrus.html">Writing, Phaedrus</a>, has this strange quality, and is very like painting; for the creatures of painting stand like living beings, but if one asks them a question, they preserve a solemn silence. And so it is with written words; you might think they spoke as if they had intelligence, but if you question them, wishing to know about their sayings, they always say only one and the same thing.</i>
			  <br /> This was true for dumb writing, but computers have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_J._Ong#Orality_and_Literacy_.281982.29">brought interactive orality to traditional literacy</a>.</li>
			<li> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">What is Code? Paul Ford, June 11 2015.</a></li>
			<li> <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript">Learn Javascript at Codecademy</a></li>
			<li> <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">Google Apps Script</a></li>
			<li> The differences between programmer, software engineer, architect, and language designer are about as vast as the differences between home cook, restaurant sous-chef, Wolfgang Puck, and Auguste Escoffier. These videos will be incomprehensible to the layman, but the breadth and depth of their sophistication should demonstrate to anyone that programming is equal to law, medicine, writing, or moviemaking: <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Bret Victor, Inventing on Principle</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0">Simplicity Matters, by Rich Hickey</a>.</li>
		  </ol>
		  
		  <h2 id="t12">Tutorial 12</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>software developer</b>, learn about Legalese's InDesign Javascript codebase so you can tweak the XML-to-PDF workflow. How does Test-Driven Development work for XMLs and PDFs? Discusses alternative methods of going from XML to PDF, such as PrinceXML.</p>

		  <h2 id="t13">Tutorial 13</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>software developer</b>, learn about Legalese's integrations with third parties. How are PDFs injected into an e-signature service?</p>
