		  <h1>Three Founders Incorporate a Company.</h1>

		  <p>Three frogs have been working on a business together. After successful customer discovery and prototype development, they are now on the cusp of either recognizing revenue or taking investment. So it's time to form a company.</p>

		  <h2>What paperwork is involved?</h2>

		  <p>While Legalese automates a lot of the process, you still have to understand the steps involved. Each workflow in Legalese comes with an explanatory diagram.</p>

<img src="../images/workflow-incorporation.png" alt="Incorporation Workflow" />

		  <p>These are the documents produced by Legalese's Singapore Incorporation workflow. In the future, Legalese will offer incorporation workflows for every jurisdiction in the world, so you can form a Delaware corporation, a BVI / Cayman vehicle, etc. For now, we use the Singapore example, because that's where the frogs happen to live.</p>

		  <h2>Clone the Google Spreadsheet</h2>

<img src="images/screenshot-spreadsheet-2015-01-08-02.35.29.png" alt="Google Docs Spreadsheet with Legalese Menu" />

		  <h2>Configure The Company</h2>

		  <p>Describe the frogs in the <em>Entities</em> tab. You will need all their deets. Now would be a good time to <a href="https://evernote.com/products/scannable/">scan</a> the founders' passports and proof of address, and save them into Google Drive, because your corporate secretary will ask to see these documents. (Tip: before you hire a corporate secretary, first ask how comfortable they are with using Google Drive and other intimidating computer technologies.)</p>

		  <h2>Generate Documents</h2>

		  <p>Click <i>Add-ons / Legalese / Generate PDFs</i>.</p>

		  <img src="images/crop-generate.png" alt="Generate Papers" />

		  <p><a href="images/01 - Memorandum and Articles of Association.pdf"><img src="images/01 - Memorandum and Articles of Association.png" width="200px" border="1"></a>

		  <p>Every time you <em>Generate PDFs</em>, Legalese creates a new folder under <i>Legalese Root</i> in your Google Drive. If you ever feel the urge to clean up, you can just delete everything under Legalese Root, and start over. You can even delete Legalese Root itself.</p>

<img src="images/crop-xml.png" alt="Generated XML" />

		  <p>Each time Legalese generates documents, they go into a new folder, timestamped with the current time.</p>

<img src="images/crop-pdfs.png" alt="Generated PDFs" />

		  <p>Under that folder you will see a bunch of PDFs. Review those docs.</p>

		  <h2>Circulate for Signature</h2>

		  <p>Open the PDF using the EchoSign Add-On and send it for signature. Look in the README file for the list of email addresses to copy and paste into EchoSign's form. They are in the correct order to match the signature blocks.</p>

<img src="images/crop-echosign.png" alt="EchoSign" />

		  <p>The PDF is EchoSign-ready, which means it's been marked up with signature blocks in the appropriate places. You can route the PDF through DocuSign or HelloSign as well, but they probably won't Do The Right Thing with the EchoSign signature boxes.</p>
