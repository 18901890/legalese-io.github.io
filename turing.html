		  <h1>Turing-Complete Contracts</h1>

		  <p>The Legalese team has started work on a JavaScript-to-English compiler. This is a research project. Software eats law in a specific way: it gets <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/turingd/">Turing'd</a>, by way of a domain-specific language.</p>

		  <p>The goal? To create a set of technologies which enable a lawyer, or a non-lawyer, to draft a contract more concisely and clearly than they could in a natural language, by writing what looks like computer code. The drafter gets to take advantage of all sorts of ideas from computer science: libraries, syntax checking, unit testing. And the drafting community has the benefit of from ideas from software engineering, like collaborative version control and opensource community support practices.</p>

		  <p>As Frederik Pohl might say, a good futurist predicts the car; a great futurist predicts the traffic jam. If the car is a formal language for contracts and agreements (maybe even legislation), then the traffic jam is smart contracts integrated with cryptocurrencies and wholly automated business processes, little distinguishable from an API.</p>

		  <h2><a name="inspiration"></a>Where does the anger come from?</h2>

		  <p>Once upon a time, a programmer received an investment contract containing the following text, verbatim:</p>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not more than S$32.5 Million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed valuation of S$27.5 million.</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at less than S$ 40 million but not below S$32.5 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of S$35 million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert at a valuation of 35M less 15% discount);</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$ 40 million but less than S$47.06 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of S$47.06 million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert at a pre-money valuation of 40M i.e. S$47.06 million less 15% discount);</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$ 47.06 million but less than S$80 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$40 million;</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$80 million but less than S$100 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$45 million; and</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$100 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$50 million.</blockquote>

		  <p style="margin-top:1.6em">Ten minutes and a strong cup of tea later, the notes in the margin read:</p>

<code style="white-space: pre-wrap">// why isn't this just
if      (seriesB < 32.5)  { conversion = 27.5 }
else if (seriesB < 40)    { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 }
else if (seriesB < 47.06) { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 } // then why the above line?
else if (seriesB < 80)    { conversion = 40 }
else if (seriesB < 100)   { conversion = 45 }
else                      { conversion = 50 }</code>

		  <p style="margin-top:1.6em">The next step is obvious: What if contracts could be written in a formal language first, and then compiled to natural language? A powerful idea.</p>

		  <p>Imagine contracts in different languages &ndash; each translation provably identical to the others. Contracts amenable to formal methods: code verification can prove that a contract is internally consistent, free of contradiction, and complete. Contracts that execute themselves in software, integrated with business processes, interacting with other contracts. This vision has been expressed by <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/contractlanguage.html">Nick Szabo (2002)</a>, by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2216866">Harry Surden (2012)</a>, by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2538224">Flood &amp; Goodenough (2014)</a>, by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5691">Camilleri, Paganelli, &amp; Schneider</a>, by <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-72952-5_11">Prisacariu &amp; Schneider</a>.</p>

		  <p>Implementing the vision is a <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SMOP.html">simple matter of programming</a>!</p>
