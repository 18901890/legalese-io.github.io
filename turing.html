		  <h1>Turing-Complete Contracts</h1>

		  <p>The Legalese team has started work on a JavaScript-to-English compiler. This is a research project.</p>

		  <h2><a name="inspiration"></a>Where does the anger come from?</h2>

		  <p>Once upon a time, a programmer received an investment contract containing the following text, verbatim:</p>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not more than S$32.5 Million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed valuation of S$27.5 million.</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at less than S$ 40 million but not below S$32.5 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of S$35 million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert at a valuation of 35M less 15% discount);</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$ 40 million but less than S$47.06 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a 15% discount over the valuation of the Series B Funding (for instance, if the series B Funding is at a valuation of S$47.06 million, then the investors in the Note shall be entitled to convert at a pre-money valuation of 40M i.e. S$47.06 million less 15% discount);</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$ 47.06 million but less than S$80 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$40 million;</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$80 million but less than S$100 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$45 million; and</blockquote>

		  <blockquote class="quotation">If the investment for the purpose of the Series B Funding is valued at not less than S$100 million, investors in the Convertible Note will be entitled to convert the Note into Shares at a fixed pre-money valuation of S$50 million.</blockquote>

		  <p style="margin-top:1.6em">Ten minutes and a strong cup of tea later, the notes in the margin read:</p>

<code style="white-space: pre-wrap">// why isn't this just
if      (seriesB < 32.5)  { conversion = 27.5 }
else if (seriesB < 40)    { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 }
else if (seriesB < 47.06) { conversion = seriesB * 0.85 } // then why the above line?
else if (seriesB < 80)    { conversion = 40 }
else if (seriesB < 100)   { conversion = 45 }
else                      { conversion = 50 }</code>

		  <p style="margin-top:1.6em">The next step is obvious: What if contracts could be written in a formal language first, and then compiled to natural language? A powerful idea.</p>

		  <p>Imagine contracts in different languages &ndash; each translation provably identical to the others. Contracts amenable to formal methods: code verification can prove that a contract is internally consistent, free of contradiction, and complete. Contracts that execute themselves in software, integrated with business processes, interacting with other contracts. This is the vision of <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/contractlanguage.html">Nick Szabo (2002)</a>, of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2216866">Harry Surden (2012)</a>, of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2538224">Flood &amp; Goodenough (2014)</a>.</p>

		  <p>Implementing the vision is a <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SMOP.html">simple matter of programming</a>.</p>
