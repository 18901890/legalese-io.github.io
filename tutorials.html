		  <p>A <b>signatory</b> fills in a Google Form and get back an agreement to sign. They don't even have to know Legalese exists.</p>

		  <ol>
			<li> In this tutorial, you see how Legalese might appear to a third-party signatory.</li>
			<li> Legalese.io takes the role of a Company, providing you an End-User License Agreement.</li>
			<li> You take the role of an end-user signing the License Agreement.</li>
			<li> In future, you will take the role of the Company generating agreements for others.</li>
			<li> Legalese.io invites you to <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/jfdi.asia/forms/d/1RIB2E2-SfXBTLKVlwhRx08UnUeYoN5yjnaJrvqZavUE/viewform">fill in a simple form with your name and email address.</a></li>
			<li> A few minutes later, check your mail. You should see a PDF agreement there. <i>If you don't receive the EULA, that's because there is a bug in the software that does OAuth integration with EchoSign. Sorry, this is still alpha software. We're working on it.</i></li>
			<li> To complete the tutorial, sign the EULA.</li>
		  </ol>

		  <p><i>After running this tutorial, you will have:</i> seen what Legalese's Particulars form looks like to a third-party signatory, seen the output PDF, and signed it.</p>

		  <h2 id="t2">Tutorial 2: Hello, World!</h2>
		  
		  <p>You set up a Yellow Spreadsheet for the first time. You are now a <b>power user</b>!</p>
		  <ol>
			<li> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rBuKOWSqRE7QgKgF6uVWR9www4LoLho4UjOCHPQplhw/copy?id=1rBuKOWSqRE7QgKgF6uVWR9www4LoLho4UjOCHPQplhw&copyCollaborators=false&copyComments=false&title=My%20Legalese%20Tutorial%202&usp=sheets_web">Copy our template to your Google Drive account.</a></li>
			<li> (Say yes to "Make a copy?")</li>
			<li> You should be in the Hello World tab. Some of the cells are bright yellow. We chose the same shade of yellow that you've seen in Word docs where you're expected to fill in the blanks.</li>
			<li> Go ahead and fill in your particulars in the blank Row 14. If you leave it blank, we'll make something up for you. Change the email address for the <i>Acme Example</i> company to be one of your email addresses.</li>
			<li> What about the cells that aren't in yellow? You can look, but don't touch. Yet.</li>
			<li> Create an agreement! Click <i>Add-ons / Legalese / Generate PDFs</i>. Approve the authorization request.</li>
			<li> Cross your fingers. Because sometimes it doesn't work. Usually it's Google's fault. But sometimes it's our fault. We're in beta. :-/</li>
			<li> If it didn't work, try again. If it still doesn't work, get <a href="support.html">support</a>.</li>
			<li> Enough pessimism! Let's assume it worked. A link will appear in cell E6 of the spreadsheet. It leads to an output folder in Google Drive.</li>
			<li> In that folder, you should see an XML file. Yay! You are not expected to understand the XML. That's the job of the Legalese Robot.</li>
			<li> Wait three minutes for the Legalese Robot to turn the XML into a PDF.</li>
			<li> (While you wait, you might check out the README file.)</li>
			<li> If, after three minutes, a PDF doesn't appear, just reload the web page.</li>
		  </ol>

		  <p> <i>After running this tutorial, you will have:</i> gotten comfortable with Legalese's Yellow Spreadsheets, created a PDF of your own, read the README, and glanced at the XML source files.</p>

		  <p><b>I noticed the output folder was shared with robot@legalese.io. What if I have confidential information?</b> Very perceptive of you! The Legalese Robot operates without any human involvement, turning XML into PDF tirelessly, day and night. In the normal course of operation, no human views your agreements. If debugging or troubleshooting is needed, only with your permission will a human view your XML or PDF files. (Errors are logged to a separate file which help us debug without ever viewing your agreements.)</p>

		  <p><b>Are the yellow spreadsheets shared?</b> No, the yellow spreadsheets are not shared with the Legalese Robot. The robot only has access to your XML, which it needs to generate the PDFs.</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="t3">Tutorial 3: Send for Signature</h2>

		  <p>You, a <b>power user</b>, inject the <i>Hello World</i> PDF into an e-signature service which emails it to you for signing.</p>

		  <ol>
			<li> Open the Google Drive folder that contains the <i>Hello World</i> PDF.</li>
			<ul>
			  <li> The folder is named <i>My Legalese Tutorial Hello World</i>.</li>
			  <li> (If you don't know how to find the folder, begin by going back to the yellow spreadsheet.)</li>
			  <li> (If you don't know how to find the yellow spreadsheet, search your Google Drive for <b>My Legalese Tutorial</b>.)</li>
			  <li> (If you don't want to search, start at <i>My Drive</i> and open <i>Legalese Root</i>. Everything that Legalese does is in there. We created this folder for you automatically.)</li>
			</ul>
			<li> Select the <i>Hello World</i> PDF.</li>
			<li> Right-click the PDF (or hit <b>a</b> if you're a keyboard geek).</li>
			<li> Open With: <i>E-Sign with EchoSign</i>.</li>
			<li> If you don't see the <i>EchoSign</i> option, click <i>Connect More Apps</i> to add it.
			<li> Enter the To: and CC: addresses based on what's shown in the README file. The order matters.</li>
			<li> If you're using EchoSign, you'll notice that the signature blocks are already in the right place.</li>
			<li> Go ahead and send for signature!</li>
		  </ol>

		  <p> <i>After running this tutorial, you will have:</i> set up an e-signature back-end and sent a PDF for signature.</p>
	  
		  <p><b>When the signature service asks me for the signers' email addresses, what should I say?</b> Open up the README file and enter the email addresses shown in the To: line.</p>

		  <p><b>What if I prefer DocuSign / HelloSign / some other e-signature backend?</b> That's fine; you can certainly do that. The advantage of EchoSign is that the PDFs contain embedded Signature Blocks which EchoSign knows how to read. If you use some other signature service, you will need to manually place the signature blocks.</p>

		  <h2 id="t4">Tutorial 4: A Real Nondisclosure Agreement</h2>
		  
		  <p>You, a <b>power user</b>, choose a real-world docset, and create a real-world agreement, taking advantage of the <i>INCLUDE</i> keyword to reuse the entities from a different tab.</p>

		  <ol>
			<li> Look at the row of tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.</li>
			<li> You will see tabs with names like <i>NDA</i>, <i>Incorporation</i>, <i>Creation of Class F Shares</i>, and <i>Seed Round</i>.</li>
			<li> Let's start with a simple agreement: a nondisclosure.</li>
		  </ol>
		  
		  <h2 id="t5">Tutorial 5</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>power user</b>, configure the spreadsheets to create <i>multiple</i> agreements within a single document set.</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="t6">Tutorial 6</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>power user</b>, browse all the docsets that are available in Legalese.</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="t7">Tutorial 7</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>content developer</b>, tweak an existing template for your own use, using Github. This involves learning a little bit of XML. You learn how to publish your template both publicly and privately. You instruct Legalese to use your template.</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="t8">Tutorial 8</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>content developer</b>, create a new template from scratch. You learn how to configure the signature blocks.</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="t9">Tutorial 9</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>software developer</b>, learn how to fork Legalese's Google Apps Javascript codebase for your own purposes.</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="t10">Tutorial 10</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>software developer</b>, learn how to fix bugs, develop tests, and submit patches for Legalese's JS codebase. How does Test-Driven Development work in for Google Apps?</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="t11">Tutorial 11</h2>
		  <p>: You, a <b>content developer</b>, learn how to fix bugs, develop tests, and submit patches for Legalese's XML template trove. How does Test-Driven Development work for contracts and legal documents?</p>
